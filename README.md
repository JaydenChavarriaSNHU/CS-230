**Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?**

-The client The Gaming Room owned an Android game that they wanted to be able to be compatable with multiple other devices including windows, linux, MacOs, and other mobuile devices. This game needed to be converted to a web based application so it could be played accross any platforms. 

**What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?**

-I wrote highly detailed reccomendation section based off of what i would believe to best suit the needs that they provided. This section both broke down what my personal reccomendations were but also how each of them worked. 

**What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?**

-When working through the design process the UML class diagram is my personal biggest help because it allows me to see the code from the outside and see how its meant to function either through relationships or where classes lie. 

**If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?**

-Personally i believe my breakdown of each operating system dealing with networking and security couldv'e used some more work. The template wasnt very friendly to look at and i believe i tried to mak it too friendly to look at without going into enough detail. 

**How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?**

-Looking at their application a few things stood out as a necessity, these being percieved speed via connection to games, how the game looks and feels on client side, and having the ability to handle alot of connections at once. The users needs are important mainly because it's what they are asking you to do, albeit it's your job to do what they say but it's also important that you can set them up for success without your intervening.

**How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?**

-I believe that breaking everything down and working on one part at a time is essential. Looking at the big picture to figure out whats most important at the time then worrying about the small details afterwards help me see the bigger picture. In the future i believe taking the same approach and breaking everything down into seperate peices can help me get work donw more efficiently and better help me design software.
